        <h3 class="mb-4"> The Moremi Statue.</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Moremi Ajasoro is a pretty big deal in the Yoruba land and she is worth every single hype she is given and more.
        </p>
        <p><img src="images/tour3.jpg" alt="Image" class="img-fluid rounded"></p>
        <p>
          Married into the royal home as the princess, she grew up into a very brave and courageous queen and ruler whose strength and bravery contributed immensely to the victory of the Yoruba tribe against the neighboring opponents known as the Forest People those days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Queen Moremi’s bravery is a tale that never ceases to amaze anyone who hears it for the very first time and those who have heard it before. This selfless queen according to tales saved the Yoruba town from raiders by allowing herself to be captured by them so that she could infiltrate their walls and learn all their secrets and strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          After she learned all there was to learn while she was in captivity, the beautiful queen escaped from the opponents and returned to Ile-ife where she told her people the secret to defeating their opponents which they did perfectly.
        </p>
        <p>
          This brave act made the queen one of the most loved and respected women in Nigerian history. There was a big statue of the queen, standing at 45 feet with a torch that was erected by the ooni recently in Owerri state. It is one of the tallest statues in Africa but this cannot be seen in Ile-Ife as it was erected in Owerri. There are so many smaller statues of the queen scattered all around Ile-Ife. One of the beautiful sculptures of this queen can be found in Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife in the “Moremi Hostel,” one of the best hostels in the campus.
