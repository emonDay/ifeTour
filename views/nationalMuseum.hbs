          In January, 1974, the idea of establishing a Natural History Museum and that which will be a leading natural history museum in the west coast of Africa was taken upon as this was to be an autonomous unit starting with the collection of the then zoology department as a nucleus.

        But due to the problem of inadequate operational space, the museum was temporarily housed in one of the buildings of the Faculty of Agricultural complex for over thirty years because of the changes in the administration of the university.

          The museum was officially inaugurated on the 25th February, 2011 and it’s renowned for its striking architecture. The museum’s herbs session has about 20,000 fully identified plants, the bird session has over 5,150 fully identified bird.

        In addition to all the fascinating things there are over 6,000 archaeological artifacts like the Ife terracotta, Ife glass beads, tobacco pipes, etc. the resources in this museum are timeless and priceless and have been a great resource to local and international researchers. This museum since it’s set up nine years ago has been at the forefront of conservation research in Nigeria.
